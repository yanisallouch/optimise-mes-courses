# My habits

## What I see today

In this section, I describe facts based on my observations during my many purchases in supermarkets.

### Budget

- I see that my daily basket is made up of items that I buy in different stores on a "shopping trip".

- I find that my ideal basket is made up of several stores, with several given addresses.

- I see that my basket is made up of (categories)[assets/main-food-categories.png] of items :
    - Cereals;
    - Breads;
    - Dairy products;
    - Fruit;
    - Eggs; Meat;
    - Meats; Fish;
    - Fish; Vegetables;
    - Vegetables;
    - Oils;
    - Pulses,nuts,seeds;
    - Sweets;
    - Alcoholic beverages;
    - Non-alcoholic beverages;

- I notice that I break down my basket by a nutritional view [macro](https://www.laboratoire-lescuyer.com/blog/nos-conseils-sante/tout-savoir-sur-les-micronutriments-macronutriments#:~:text=Les%20macronutrients%20sont%20les%20%C3%A9l%C3%A9ments,'apportent%20pas%20d'%C3%A9nergie.) :
    - Carbohydrates;
    - Protein;
    - Fats.

- I notice that the view [macronutrient](https://www.laboratoire-lescuyer.com/blog/nos-conseils-sante/tout-savoir-sur-les-micronutriments-macronutriments#:~:text=The%20macronutrients%20are%20the%20%C3%A9l%C3%A9ments,'bring%20no%20energy.) groups together categories of items:
    - Carbohydrates : 
        - Breads, cereals, fruit, vegetables and sweet products;
    - Proteins :
        - Meat, fish, vegetables, eggs, nuts and dairy products;
    - Lipids :
        - Across oils, fish, seeds, nuts, wholegrain cereals, fruit and dairy products.


- I can see that the prices of items change over time within a given chain for a given address.


- I can see that prices are fairly regular over a given period of time, depending on the category of the item:
    - Vegetables, fruit: 3 months;
    - Cereals: 6 months;
    - Meat: 1 year.


- I've also noticed that home-delivered or drive-through shopping can be cheaper, but requires a minimum purchase, which isn't always justified.


- I find that buying fresh seasonal produce is generally cheaper on :
    - vegetables;
    - fruit.


- I've found that buying meat from a butcher offers superior quality for the same price. Sometimes not. The price is too high for equivalent quality.


### Time

- I find that I take less than half an hour to organize my shopping schedule for at least 1 week, or even 2 weeks.

- I find that I look at my cupboard and fridge to know what to buy.

- I find that the items I buy are predictable in terms of how long they will last. For example, oatmeal, chocolate and rice keep well and I consume them in fixed quantities, which makes them easier to plan.

- I find that it takes me about an hour to do a "run". This includes the time it takes to get there and back, plus the time it takes to make a purchase in the store (shelf & waiting time in a queue).

- I find that the minimum journey time is 10 min.

- I see that the maximum travel time is 30 min.

- I find that the minimum shopping time is 15 min.

- I find that the maximum purchase time is 30min.

- I find that it takes me about half a day to prepare all my meals for a week.

- I find that there is a minimum time regardless of the number of meals prepared.

- I can see that there is an additional time limit above a certain number of meals.

- I've found that I can parralelize the cooking time for certain meals, thanks to the hob's four burners.

- I find that during this cooking time I prepare vegetables and meat for the same number of meals prepared. Example 4 pans of rice = 4 pans of vegetables being prepared + 4 pans of meat being prepared.

- I notice that my diet evolves over time. This implies an increase/decrease in the quantities/items consumed.

## Equipment

- I can see that more items can be transported by bicycle.

- I find that I can transport around 20Kg per trip.

- I realize that eggs must be placed at the top of the bag or in their own bag to avoid damage.
